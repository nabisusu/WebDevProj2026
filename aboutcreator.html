     <p> Susana is the creator of this page with a mixed background
        of both American and Peruvian with Quechua lineage. 
        Quechua is both a language and a people. Susana continues
        to do ongoing research about the Quechua language, native
        to the people of Peru before the Spanish attempted to wipe
        out the entirety of the people's ideologies and language 
        and replacing it with their own, like their language; Spanish.
